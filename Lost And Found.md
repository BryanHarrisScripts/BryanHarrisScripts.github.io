Create a 30-second video with limited motion that tells a story.

1. Choose a Material & Concept:
   - Static Images with Voiceover
   - Kinetic Typography
   - Stop Motion
   - Digital Animation
   - Slide Show with Music
   - Interview/Testimonial Style

2. Incorporate Creative Elements:
   - Close-ups

3. Sample Story Concept:

   - Concept: B&W photos of a child's lost toy in various locations. Toward the end, color bursts into the scene as a child picks up the toy against a sunset.
   - Voiceover: "It was left behind, waiting, watching the world move. Alone on benches, streets, and cafes. But every lost story has an end. And in the warmth of a sunset, it found its way home."
