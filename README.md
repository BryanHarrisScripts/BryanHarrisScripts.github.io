# A New Way

Imagine a platform tailored for open-source scripts, merging Github's collaborative nature with the intricacies of screenwriting ‚Äî now with an AI companion to guide and nurture. Picture a space where writers not only unite to polish their stories but also receive AI-powered suggestions to hone their unique voice. Essential to this is a robust system, one that can efficiently offer feedback, track edits, shield intellectual property, and encourage sincere cooperation.

Envision layering this with web3 technology.

By integrating web3, the platform becomes decentralized, providing writers authentic ownership of their content through cryptographic tokens. It safeguards their intellectual property while unveiling avenues for earning. Feedback, both from the community and AI insights, can be incentivized with token rewards. Plus, smart contracts facilitate the automated management of permissions, rights, and even the splitting of profits from collaborative endeavors.

Melding open-source collaboration, AI support, and web3's decentralized advantages, we're on the verge of a revolutionary evolution in scriptwriting. This convergence can redefine how narratives are developed, shared, and refined.

### From Page to Screen

In Hollywood's vibrant core, where cinematic aspirations abound, the journey is daunting. Every year, over 50,000 screenplays get registered with the Writers Guild of America (WGA). Yet, as evidenced by 2019, the U.S. produces a mere 800 movies annually, highlighting the fierce rivalry.

Being optimistic, if every movie came from a fresh script of that year, a mere 1.6% would materialize on screen. And this is generous, given many films are sequels, novel adaptations, or scripts that have waited long for their spotlight. Moreover, the 50,000 doesn't encompass all; numerous scripts never get to the WGA, staying concealed.

However, the value of a screenplay isn't only in its realization on screen. For numerous individuals, it's an entry to the movie world. An engaging script, even if not made into a film, can pave the way for other ventures. For emerging screenwriters, perfecting their craft is paramount. AI can assist here, helping writers refine their scripts, ensuring they not only stand out in numbers but also in quality. Remember, every renowned screenwriter commenced with a sole vision and an untouched page.

# Welcome to the 'Afterglow' Journey

Hello, fellow creators! Welcome to 'Afterglow'. Whether you're a screenwriter, an educator, a student, a hobbyist, or just a curious soul, you're in the right place. I'm Bryan Harris, an independent writer with a background in film studies.

'Afterglow' started as a project to understand how a screenplay could thrive on a platform like Twitter, and to gauge interest in the story. It quickly evolved into more than that, turning into an open-source endeavour that invites collaboration, sharing of ideas, and creative exploration. This space is more than just a repository for screenwriters‚Äîit's a place where we can join forces to transform a passion for writing into captivating narratives.

In the process of this experiment, I also employed AI tools to refine the original screenplay. The objective was not to replace the human touch, but to understand how artificial intelligence can assist in enhancing and structuring our creative thoughts.

This space is also for exploring the use of AI in creativity, sharing resources, and learning from our collective experiences. The decision to incorporate AI into your creative process is entirely up to you. Remember, it's not about AI creating, but about AI helping us create more effectively.

Join me on this journey of exploration, innovation, and creative collaboration. Welcome aboard the 'Afterglow' journey!
This space is for exploring the use of AI in creativity and sharing resources and experiences. Whether you choose to incorporate AI into your creative process is entirely your decision.

# The Unseen Editor
### An AI-Assisted Adventure

In my current project, I've been rewriting a script with the help of artificial intelligence. If this technology truly holds value, why aren't studios knocking at my door or expressing interest in the script? I've released it as open-source and have been persistently refining it with AI, making this the second AI-assisted rewrite...

**I wrote the Afterglow script in 2017**, which was later rewritten with AI assistance in 2023.

> James Cameron once said, "I just don‚Äôt personally believe that a disembodied mind that‚Äôs just regurgitating
what other embodied minds have said ‚Äî about the life that they‚Äôve had, about love, about lying, about fear,
about mortality ‚Äî and just put it all together into a word salad and then regurgitate it‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs
ever going to have something that‚Äôs going to move an audience. You have to be human to write that. I don‚Äôt know
anyone that‚Äôs even thinking about having AI write a screenplay." - Variety

I'm in agreement with James Cameron. 

While creating scripts entirely with AI may be challenging without human intervention, I believe that **human-written scripts** edited with AI assistance, as I'm currently doing, are indeed feasible.

## AI in Screenwriting: A New Tool, Not a Co-Author

The ChatGPT-4 language model served as an integral tool during the development process of 'Afterglow'. Its primary function was not to generate independent ideas, but to aid in language optimization, text refinement, and the articulation of existing concepts.

Consider it akin to the role of a skilled editor: enhancing clarity, eliminating redundancy, and presenting ideas in a more coherent and engaging manner. Yet, unlike a human editor, AI does not bring its own ideas or creative inputs. All original thought, from core narrative decisions to thematic development, character creation, and plot structuring, originated from me.

The contributions of ChatGPT-4 should be viewed as a rephrasing and restructuring of my original ideas - a way to present my thoughts using better linguistic structure without altering the core essence. Its role was to elevate the communication of my narrative, much like how Robert Kearns improved the windshield wiper without changing its original function.

As per current legal and ethical considerations (as of September 2021), AI systems cannot be attributed with authorship rights, nor can they be credited or held accountable for the content they assist in producing. AI's involvement is purely facilitative, acting as a sophisticated tool to enhance the writer's original creative vision.

<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

## AI in Creativity: A Disclaimer

Consider your personal comfort, creative needs, and ethical viewpoints. As this field is novel and constantly evolving, legal consultation or intellectual property rights expertise may be required.

**Note**: As per legal and ethical considerations up until September 2021, AI systems, such as ChatGPT-4, do not possess authorship rights or assume responsibility for the content they aid in generating. Their function is akin to that of a sophisticated editorial tool, aiding in language optimization and text refinement without contributing original ideas or themes.

- In this context, the primary authorship of 'Afterglow' remains under my name, Bryan Harris. The utilization of AI in this project does not imply a co-authorship situation but rather an advanced tool assisting in the creative process. Hence, despite the engagement of AI, this does not constitute plagiarism but a modern approach to enhancing original work.

- Current guidelines dictate that AI does not have authorship rights. Therefore, while it is instrumental in the process of creation, it does not bear the role of a co-creator or independent author. Consequently, the ultimate ownership and credit of the final work rest with the human author.

**Note**: The outcomes of using AI in screenwriting are not guaranteed. Any losses or damages incurred due to your use of AI technology are your responsibility.

Join me as we journey into this new creative frontier, with open minds, critical thinking, and a spirit of collaboration. Let's tell compelling stories and bring them to life, with or without the aid of AI.

Welcome aboard the 'Afterglow' journey!

## Understanding Copyright 

#### Traditional Copyright vs Open Source Licensing

**Screenwriters typically have traditional copyrights for their works**, which means they reserve all rights to the content they have created. This allows them to control how the work is used, distributed, and modified, often through legal agreements with studios and producers.

**Open Source licensing, such as the Creative Commons ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0), is different.** This type of license allows others to share, modify, and even build upon the work, provided they give proper attribution to the original author and license their new creations under the identical terms. It's a more permissive way of sharing creative works.

In most professional screenwriting contexts, the traditional copyright model would be more common, while the open-source model would be more aligned with collaborative or community-driven projects. They serve different purposes and are used in different contexts based on the creator's intent and the nature of the project.

https://creativecommons.org/get-cc-savvy/copyright-creativecommons-are-friends/

#### User Contributions and Ownership

If a user provides feedback, such as suggestions, ideas, or specific textual contributions, the ownership of the copyright for that material can vary based on the context and any agreements in place.

1. **No Specific Agreement**: If there's no specific agreement or terms of service that address the issue, the user generally retains copyright of their original material.
2. **Terms of Service Agreement**: Many platforms and services include clauses in their terms of service that users agree to upon participating. These may stipulate that any contributions, including feedback, become the property of the platform or may be used by the platform in various ways. In such cases, the user might relinquish some or all rights to their contributions.
3. **Formal Collaboration or Contract**: If the feedback is part of a formal collaboration or under a specific contract, the ownership of the copyright would be defined by that agreement.

#### Collaboration Under CC BY-SA 4.0

If you update your original work with someone else's change and want to acknowledge them, they would typically be considered a contributor to that specific change or modification. Under the Creative Commons ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0) license, the new combined work would still be shared under the same license.

The key provisions of CC BY-SA 4.0 are:
- **Attribution**: Users must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.
- **ShareAlike**: If a user remixes, transforms, or builds upon the material, they must distribute their contributions under the same license as the original.

1. So, if someone modifies your work under this license, they own the copyright to the changes they made, but they must also license their derivative work under the same terms (CC BY-SA 4.0). This ensures that the derivative work remains open and accessible in the same way as the original, creating a collaborative chain where each contributor retains rights to their contributions while adhering to the shared principles of the license.

2. The contributor does not have ownership over the entire updated work but retains copyright over their specific contribution. By integrating their change into your original work, you are essentially creating a derivative work, and you would usually attribute them in the way you both agree upon or as stated in the license (e.g., naming them in the credits, providing a link to their profile, etc.). **Note:** I will communicate with the contributor to make sure we both understand and agree on how the contribution will be used and credited.

**Note**: While you retain copyright over your contribution, by contributing to this project, you agree to license your work under CC BY-SA 4.0. This allows others to remix, adapt, and build upon your contribution, even for commercial purposes, provided they give appropriate credit and license their derivative works under the same terms. Please ensure you understand the terms of this license before contributing.

Please note that while this outlines general principles related to copyright and collaboration, it is not a substitute for legal advice. If you have specific legal concerns or require a tailored agreement, please consult with a legal professional specializing in intellectual property law in your jurisdiction.
