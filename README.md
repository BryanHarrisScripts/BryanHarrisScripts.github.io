The primary purpose behind establishing Open Source Storytelling was to share the script of my screenplay, "Afterglow," with the world. I realized that many of my creations were confined to a computer hard drive, and it made sense to share them under an open-source license. This was my initial focus.

However, as I delved deeper into the editing process, I began consulting books I had acquired and interacting with ChatGPT. This interaction prompted me to construct a resource for budding screenwriters. Consequently, this is how the inception of this website on GitHub occurred.

GitHub serves as a suitable platform as it is not only a repository for my scripts but also offers a revision control system, allowing for structured and organized management of the scripts. Thus, this website is more than a space to share my work; it is a comprehensive resource for amateur screenwriters, providing them with valuable references and insights to facilitate their learning and development in screenplay writing.

## A, I, Human Manifesto

**Your Actions Define You**

I navigate life with a purpose that extends beyond self, celebrating the collective journey shaped by passions, family ties, and shared wisdom. My family, especially my grandkids, are my constant beacon, reminding me of the legacies we craft and inherit.

In every endeavour, I bridge the digital with the tangible, upholding a commitment to integrity and professionalism, ever mindful of the trust others place in me. "Afterglow" isn't just about individual triumphs; it's a testament to the unwavering support and collaborations that have uplifted me in moments of doubt.

Stories are not solely mine. They weave in memories, mentorships, and collective innovation, even as I, like many, navigate moments of self-doubt. Guided by tools like ChatGPT, I'm reminded of our shared achievements and aspirations. Digital connections, for me, are echoes of teamwork, shared laughter, and heartfelt moments with family.

My journey, marked by peaks and valleys, is a shared testament. It aims to inspire, with roots deep in authenticity and a commitment to mutual respect and growth. Every step I take is enriched by the wisdom and guidance of those around me.

Harnessing technology, I and many others craft tales that merge human emotions with digital nuances, always prioritizing collective well-being and genuine connections. Hand in hand with those who've been my pillars, our narrative is one of mutual growth, gratitude, and evolution.

This narrative, more than just words, is a shared compass. It illuminates every collaborative effort, family bond, and collective stride, crafted with love and mutual respect.

Together, in every endeavour, we reflect a symphony of values, dedication, and the steadfast support of our cherished community.

## Guiding Manifesto

Always forge ahead, seizing every thought, recognizing its origin and intent. Transform the triggers, and resist the urge to interpret unsaid words or emotions in spaces I occupy.

Recognize that thoughts shape emotions, which in turn guide actions. Stay anchored in motivations that fuel my spirit. When tangled in thoughts, question their authenticity‚Äîdo they stand the test of truth?

**Your Actions Define You.**

## Guiding Stars

My true north is shaped by values and skills, both innate and learned and a relentless pursuit of genuine joy and pleasure.
